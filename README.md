# Dragoman Text Mining

Dragoman Text Mining is part of the <a href= "https://dragomans.digital.utsc.utoronto.ca/node/804"> Dragoman Renaissance project </a> at University of Toronto Scarborough. I am exploring the analytical affordances of mining the corpusâ€™ Italian transcriptions to better understand translation practices. I am currently preparing a model for extracting genre terms (including alternate spellings and contractions) for further study. 

I will list below the steps that involved in the process of extracting genre terms.

# Step 1:
  1. I use Python Jupyter Notebook at <a href= "https://www.scinethpc.ca/"> SciNet Advanced Computing </a> at University of Toronto
  2. I use two documents: Italian transcription and vocabulary list that contains terms which are manually identified for automatic extraction of 
  them and their alternat spellings and contractions. 
  3. The aim is to use the vocabulary list to extract the terms, and their alternat spellings and contractions in Italian transcriptions. 
  4. Python presents a significant challenge when it comes to reading the above-mentioned documents as they often contain not just characters but also a variety of symbols that are essential components of the words. 
  5. I encoded the files using uft-8
