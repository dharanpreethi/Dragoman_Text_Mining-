# Dragoman Text Mining

Dragoman Text Mining is part of the <a href= "https://dragomans.digital.utsc.utoronto.ca/node/804"> Dragoman Renaissance project </a> at University of Toronto Scarborough. I am exploring the analytical affordances of mining the corpusâ€™ Italian transcriptions to better understand translation practices.

  2. I downloaded the files and encoded them to uft-8
