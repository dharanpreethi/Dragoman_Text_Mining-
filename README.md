# Dragoman Text Mining

Dragoman Text Mining is part of the <a href= "https://dragomans.digital.utsc.utoronto.ca/node/804"> Dragoman Renaissance project </a> at University of Toronto Scarborough. I am exploring the analytical affordances of mining the corpusâ€™ Italian transcriptions to better understand translation practices. I am currently preparing a model for extracting genre terms (including alternate spellings and contractions) for further study. 

I will list below the steps that involved in the process of extracting genre terms.

# Step 1:
  1. I use Python Jupyter Notebook at <a href= "https://www.scinethpc.ca/"> SciNet Advanced Computing </a> at University of Toronto
  2. I use two documents: Italian transcription and vocabulary list
  3. The aim is to use the vocabulary list to extract the terms, and their alternat spellings and contractions in Italian transcriptions. 
  4. Python presents a significant challenge when it comes to reading the above-mentioned documents as they often contain not just characters but also a variety of symbols that are essential components of the words. 
  5. I encoded the files using uft-8

# Step 2:
  1. After many trials and errors, I idenitified a few best ways to study the terms in the Itaian transcription. In the vocabulary list, first I started exploring chancery genres for scholarly understanding of terms, its alternate spellings and contractions, and its translation practices over the periods. 
  2. It has statges: 1. Identifying and extracting genre terms, its alternate spellings and contractions from the transcription
                     2. Retrieving and quantifyting the terms according to the frequency of its alternate spellings and contractions 
                     3. Visualizing the quantification
